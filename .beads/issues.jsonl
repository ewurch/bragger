Should follow similar patterns to resume-builder: takes LinkedIn PDF + job description, outputs HTML cover letter to output/ directory.","design":"## Design Decisions\n\n### Inputs\n- Requires a generated resume first (from /resume-builder)\n- LinkedIn PDF + Job Description (same as resume-builder)\n- Optional: personal context/story if the skill detects it would strengthen the application\n\n### Behavior\n1. Read the generated resume to ensure consistency\n2. Analyze JD to detect if personal story would help (startups, mission-driven companies)\n3. If yes, prompt user for personal context relevant to the role\n4. Detect region from JD, prompt user to confirm regional format\n5. Generate cover letter that references achievements from the resume\n\n### Styling\n- Must match resume template (same colors, fonts, branding)\n- When template-builder exists, use custom template if available\n\n### Regional Variations\n- US: Brief, direct, 3 paragraphs max\n- EU: More formal, can be longer\n- Germany: Very formal tone\n- Nordics: Can be slightly informal\n- Prompt user to confirm detected region\n\n### Output\n- HTML file in output/ directory\n- Naming: cover_letter_[company]_[role].html","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-24T10:27:26.971871-03:00","updated_at":"2025-12-24T11:20:50.113877-03:00","closed_at":"2025-12-24T11:20:50.113877-03:00","close_reason":"Implemented /cover-letter skill with: resume prerequisite, matching styling, personal context prompting for startups/mission-driven roles, regional format detection with user confirmation"}
