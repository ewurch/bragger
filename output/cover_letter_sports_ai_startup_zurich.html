    <div class="salutation">Dear Hiring Team,</div>

    <div class="body">
        <p>
            I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior AI Engineer position.
        </p>

        <p>
            Growing up, I was constantly drawn to movement and physical challenges: tennis, climbing, sailing, skateboarding, surfing, and kitesurfing all shaped my childhood. This curiosity extended beyond sports into understanding how our bodies respond to different inputs. Over the years, I've experimented different lifestyles as well, eliminating sugar, then moving through low-carb, keto, and even carnivore approaches. Each experiment taught me something fundamental: <span class="highlight">our bodies are N=1 experiments</span>, and what works for one person may not work for another. This is precisely why I believe personalized AI coaching is the optimal approach. The opportunity to build technology that helps people discover their own optimal path to performance is exactly the kind of work I want to dedicate myself to.
        </p>

        <p>
            Professionally, I bring 5+ years of hands-on AI engineering experience with a focus on translating prototypes into production-ready systems. At Labrynth, I currently design and deploy agentic AI workflows using LLMs, RAG pipelines, and multi-step orchestration, building evaluation frameworks to optimize system performance and reliability. As co-founder of Parka, I've experienced firsthand the intensity and ownership that comes with early-stage work: making architectural decisions, mentoring team members, and shipping solutions end-to-end. My background spans the full ML lifecycle, from model development through deployment and monitoring, with deep expertise in Python, PyTorch, and cloud infrastructure.
